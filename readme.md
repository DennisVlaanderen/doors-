# Doors+ Mod
This repository is used to track the code for the Stonehearth Mod "Doors+". This Mod adds a bunch of extra doors into the game that allow for different buildstyles than the doors already provided by the game itself and the [ACE mod](https://github.com/StonehearthACE-team/stonehearth_ace).

# Installation
At this point the mod is not ready yet for public testing, therefore installation is discouraged. If you wish to test the mod however you can download the source-code from this repository and place the folder containing the `manifest.json` file and it's subfolders into the mods-folder of your Stonehearth installation.
