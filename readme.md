# Doors+ Mod

This repository is used to track the code for the Stonehearth Mod "Doors+". This Mod adds a bunch of extra doors into the game that allow for different buildstyles than the doors already provided by the game itself and the [ACE mod](https://github.com/StonehearthACE-team/stonehearth_ace).

## Installation

At this point the mod is not ready yet for public testing, therefore installation is discouraged. If you wish to test the mod however you can download the source-code from this repository and place the folder containing the `manifest.json` file and it's subfolders into the mods-folder of your Stonehearth installation.

## Contributions

All the models and ideas in this repository were made by Darth_Smuckleton on the [ACE Community Discord](https://discord.gg/b3wHG34). I take no credit for them whatsoever. All that I have done is add the required json files to register the items in the game and have them functional in gameplay scenario's. The animations for the models have been made by Stmpnk from the same community.
